Public repository of  "Stress-Induced Cooperation Promotes Tolerance in Resource-Limited Auxotrophic Microbial Consortia"

Scripts and notebooks used to produce figures and simulations related to the theoretical model from:

**Stress-Induced Cooperation Promotes Tolerance in Resource-Limited Auxotrophic Microbial Consortia**  
_D Reyes-Gonzalez, H de Luna-Valenciano, F Santos-Escobar, M Rebolleda-Gomez, R Pe\~na-Mille and A Fuentes-Hernandez_.

## Overview

This repository contains the data analysis and modeling framework for evaluating the effects of chloramphenicol (CHL) on cooperative bacterial consortia under nutrient-limited conditions. It includes two core Jupyter Notebooks:

## Jupyter Notebooks

### [ProfileCHL_data.ipynb](ProfileCHL_data.ipynb)  
Performs quantitative analysis of experimental data, including growth measurements, flow cytometry, and colony expansion assays across CHL and amino acid supplementation gradients. 

### [ProfileCHL_model.ipynb](ProfileCHL_model.ipynb)  
Implements a mechanistic resource allocation model to simulate the impact of translational inhibition on cooperative metabolism. The notebook explores parameter sweeps and predicts growth and metabolite exchange dynamics under varying nutrient and antibiotic conditions.
